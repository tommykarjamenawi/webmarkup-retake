        <h1>The surroundings</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Taekwon Heemstede has many facilities around its vicinity. Such as a small convenient store that has been around for 70 years. It is a small store so don’t expect that they have all the brands, but at least the basic things you need in life.
      </p>
      <p>There is also a daycare if you need to drop off your children if you need to go to work. They have a mini playground for the kids to enjoy their time. All the caregivers offer good support so that all the children are safe and learn in the
        process. They learn basic reading in a playful way. The primary function of a daycare center is to provide a safe and secure environment with quality caregivers, so that parents have the peace of mind of knowing their children are safe while
        they work.</p>
      <p>There is also a lot of small businesses in the neighborhood, think about repair shops or hairdressers. The hairdresser is one of the most famous in the neighborhood, they have been around for a long time and they have many local customers.
        We suggest get your hair done in that shop for sure. </p>
      <p>There is a centralized area to collect garbage that is separated into different type of garbage such as glass, paper, electronics etc. every Thursday the cleaners will empty the garbage.</p>
      <p>There are no tourist attractions since it is a residential area for the daily living and thus not meant for tourists. If you still want to be the tourist in town, I suggest just visiting every store is a must.</p>
      <p>There is a hill called “by children”, it is a spot where you can go downhill with your skateboard. You can see many children skating downhill in the spring and summer. While you are there you can enjoy the beautiful view of the river and the
        common drone races above the farmlands.</p>

      <h1>What is Jiu Jitsu?</h1>
      <p>Jiu Jitsu is a centuries-old Japanese martial art. It was part of the training of the Samurai (the Japanese knights) who had to survive on the battlefield without their weapons. Over time, other well-known sports have emerged from Jiu Jitsu,
        such as Judo and Aikido.</p>
      <p>The techniques from Judo and Aikido also come back to a large extent in the Jiu Jitsu lessons as they are given in the dojo on Friday evening. But in addition to the throws and clamps from Judo and Aikido, there are also kicks and punches as
        practiced in karate.</p>
      <p>The lessons can be followed around the age of 10, where not only the self-defense aspect of Jiu Jitsu is trained, but also the discipline and respect that comes with practicing a Japanese martial art.The lessons can be followed around the
